# desktop-pan-tilt-unit

A fully 3D‑printable, desktop‑scale experimental platform for studying **pointing, calibration, and physical actuation**.

## Overview

This project is a small **mechatronics / embedded systems demo** built around an ESP32‑S3 (DevKitC).  
It combines custom 3D‑printed parts with easily available mechanical components (e.g. M3 hardware) to create a **pan‑tilt pointing mechanism**.

The system is designed to orient lightweight devices in space, such as:
- low‑power laser pointers (visual feedback)
- small cameras
- toy‑grade foam dart mechanisms

The focus is on **control, calibration, and mechanical design**, not on performance or force.

## Disclaimer

This project is intended strictly as a **harmless toy / technical demonstration**.  
It uses **low‑energy, non‑hazardous components** and is **not designed for autonomous targeting or harmful use**.

## Hardware

- ESP32‑S3 DevKitC
- 3D‑printed structural components
- Standard off‑the‑shelf fasteners (M3 screws, nuts, bearings)
- Optional end‑effectors (laser pointer, camera, foam dart toy)
<!-- 
## Goals

- Desktop‑scale, low‑cost pan‑tilt mechanism
- Fully open and reproducible build
- Clear separation between mechanics, electronics, and control logic -->
